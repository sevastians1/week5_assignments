#Visualize your schema

Open this file in your text editor and visualize your schema. At the top is your table name. Listed below are all the columns in that table.

User
id first_name last_name

Address
id user_id street street2 city state zip_code country

In the example above, each Address can belong to a User. This is achieved by adding a column called user_id, which can match only ONE of the values in the id column of the User table. Remember, ids are unique; no table can have two id values that are the same.

Using the above format, jot down the database for your apps below!
